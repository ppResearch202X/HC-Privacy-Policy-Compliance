In-App Community
When you share and communicate using our community features in the App, you select the audience for the post. If you select the 'Public' option for your audience, anyone who has joined the App community platform can also view it.
This includes your username and any content you share as a post, comment, or question within the App community. Public information can also be seen, accessed, reshared, or downloaded through third-party services such as search engines, APIs, and by other services that integrate with our Services.
You should carefully consider what you choose to share on the App community platform because people who can see your activity on our Services can choose to share it with others on and off our Services platform, including people and businesses outside the audience you shared with. For example, when you share a post with specific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot, or reshare that content to others across or off our Services, in person or in virtual reality experiences. Also, when you comment on someone else's post or react to their content, your comment or reaction is visible to anyone who can see the other person's content.
Other users can also use our Services to create and share content about you with the community. If you are uncomfortable with what others have shared in our Services, you can report the content to our administrators by contacting us at healthfemo@gmail.com .
Cookies, Software Development Kits, and Other Technologies
When you use the Services, we and our vendors may use cookies or similar technologies (such as software development kits (SDKs)) to collect or receive certain information about your use of the Services. Some of these technologies that we use are 'strictly necessary' or 'required' for the Services to function. We also use analytics tools, such as to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Services. Such analytics tools may provide data, such as information about your engagement with the Services which may be used to provide content, analysis or functionality or to measure and analyze engagement with the Services.
Your Choices. Most browsers and devices are configured to accept cookies and similar tracking technologies automatically. You may be able to set your browser and device options so to limit such technologies. Choices are typically device and browser specific. Please see https://allaboutcookies.org/how-to-manage-cookies for additional information.
Retention of Your Personal Information
We will retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected and processed, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, accounting or reporting requirements. To determine the appropriate retention period for your Personal Information, we will consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Information, the potential risk from unauthorized use or disclosure, the purposes for which we process Personal Information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and applicable legal requirements.
If you choose to delete the App from your device (note that deletion of the App does not mean that your account is deleted – please contact us at healthfemo@gmail.com if you wish to delete your account) or your account becomes inactive, we will retain your Personal Information for a period of five (5) years in case you decide to re-activate the Services or re-install the App. We have determined that this retention period is appropriate taking into account the factors described above and based on our experience with our App users, in order to secure your smooth experience with our App functions.
You may delete your account and erase your Personal Information at any time in our App or contact us at healthfemo@gmail.com . Please note that if you choose to do this, your Personal Information will not be recoverable should you later create another account.
Please note that, in all cases, we may need to retain Personal Information for a longer period where we are subject to legal or regulatory requirements to do so.
Information Security
We believe that the largest threat to security and privacy is that someone could get your device and account information.

We use intelligent algorithms that provide certain App functions, such as predictions of your cycle and ovulation day. The more Personal Data about your cycle, ovulation tests, and BBT that our intelligence algorithm can work with, the better predictions you get from the algorithm.
We hope that you don't ever have an issue with the way that we handle your Personal Data, but if you do, contact us at healthfemo@gmail.com to let us know so that we can make it right. If you're ever not happy with the way that we handle your request, you can file a complaint with your local supervisory authority.
